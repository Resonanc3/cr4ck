Once Downloaded, make sure that python is installed on your android. To install python using Termux on Android, simply type the following commands "pkg install python"

When download is finished, navigate to the location where you downloaded cr4ck using the "cd" command.
Example: cd /Internal Storage/Downloads

If you are not sure which current directory you are in, simple type the "pwd" command.

Once the file is located, type the following command to run the file "python cr4ck.py"

NOTE: This has not been tested yet on Android as the commands on installing libraries in Termux is different on cmd. I will provide fixes for this program soon.
